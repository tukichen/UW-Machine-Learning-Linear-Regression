# UW-Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression

### Project: Predicting house prices: build predictive models for price using input features (sqft, # bedrooms and bathrooms,...).

* Build regression models (linear, ridge, lasso, kNN, SVM)  
* Feature selection, model optimization and selection using CV, Assess impact of outliers. 
* Implement optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.
